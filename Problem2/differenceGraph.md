Design Studio Analysis
----------------------

* Trends: In general, population is trending up, and very fast.  
* More recent absolute numbers and projections are considerably closer in estimates than ancient numbers. 
* Absolute differences are actually far worse in current numbers and projectsion -- but this isn't the case in relative terms (100,000,000 in uncertainty isn't so much when you've got 9,000,000,000 people, but it looks like an incredible mistake if you're only got 300,000,000).


Implementation Arguments
------------------------

I ended up doing the multple views (trendlines, number vs. average, percentage vs. average) because I felt that that gives you the best context for what you're looking at.
